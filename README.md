A small programme to tell the user if the tool they are looking for is in the inventory.
Able to list up the tools in the inventory and scale with more tools added.


## Compile and run
To compile quick and dirty with clang just

```bash
#for macOs/Linux
clang -std=gnu2y -g -o main src/main.c
```
or
```bash
#for Windows (I think this is how)
clang -std=gnu2y -g -o main.exe src/main.c
```

And then run
```bash
#for macOs/Linux
./main
```
Or
```cmd
#for Windows (I think this is how)
main.exe
```
